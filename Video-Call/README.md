## This NodeJs server creates, maintains the video-calls and chats also it is the part which talks with the mongo Database deployed on azure

### It creates a `socket` connection with the clients and will recieve msg from one client in a room and send it to everyone else in the same room, The `Peer-connection script` in the `ğŸ“‚public/ğŸ“‚scripts` makes a peer-to-peer connection with every client in a room with webrtc and sends flow of data i.e. Video,audio that we use for the videocall.
### Executing the following code we recieve the peer instancce from the peer server and will create a `webrtc client` that we have created in the folder `ğŸ“‚peerserver`

```javascript
const myPeer = new Peer(undefined, {
  key:'peerjs',
  host: 'debo-peerjs.herokuapp.com',
  port: '',
  secure:true,
    // this config contains the ice-server configs(turn,stun servers)
   config: {'iceServers':[
    { url: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    {
      url: 'turn_url',
      credential: 'turn_password',
      username: 'turn_username'
  }
  ]}});
```

<mark>In this Code and Explanation `iceserver,stun,turn` are some keywords used. I have explained this things why we use them and what they are in this [video](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Aqiu0gLTQJGHji8VLAzz5nWOgCJF)(This onedrive page need a reload sometimes). </mark>
