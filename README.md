# This repo Contains three folders
## Each of them do different things and are deployed separetly
## Combined they make the Video-Call and Chat Application Run Seamlessly.
## - ğŸ“‚[Client](#client) (This is a Page which makes joining and Creating Video-Calls and chat easier)
## - ğŸ“‚[peerserver](#peerserver) (This is the server which creates the peer server of `peerjs` npm library , On request this gives us an peer instancde which helps us creating and maintaining `webrtc` connection and sending Data flawlessly . more info [here](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server))
## - ğŸ“‚[Video-Call](#video-call) (This is the server that handles the webrtc and socket connections and delivers the frontend by rendering `ejs` files. )
<b>Three of this folders are explained below. Their file structure and what files/folder does what is writen below.
The code is explained in the code-comments.</b>

# Client
## To start go the the `*../client` ğŸ“‚folder in terminal and run the command 
```bash
npm start
```
## This Page lets us join/create Video-Calls and joining chats easier
- ### For creating meeting it asks for name and creates a new meet and joins to that meet
- ### For joining a meet/chat it asks for the meeting Id and Name and Joins the meet/chat
## [ This Page is made using React](#getting-started-with-create-react-app)

# peerserver
## To start go the the `*../peerserver` ğŸ“‚folder in terminal and run the command 
```bash
npm start
```
## This is the peerserver made using `peerjs` npm library.
Whenever we send a req to this server with proper info it proviodes us with a peer instance which helps us in creating webrtc connection and sending and getting data from the other peers connected.
## The file structure is explained below.
- ğŸ“‚node_modules (will be there after installing node modules)
- ğŸ“œ.gitignore (to ignore some specified files(wrriten in this file) by git)

- ğŸ“œpackage-lock.json (this is used to save npm packages supporting packages version)

- ğŸ“œpackage.json (this is used to store npm configurations,package versions and more npm stuff)
- ğŸ“œpeerserver.js (this file acctually creates the peerserver by importing the peer package and creating a server with its builtin `PeerServer` function )

- ğŸ“œReadme.md (this is what you are Reading)
>more info on can be found [here](https://github.com/peers/peerjs-server).

# Video-Call
## To start go the the `*../Video-Call` ğŸ“‚folder in terminal and run the command 
```bash
npm start
```
## This is the node server that handles the webrtc and socket connections and delivers the frontend by rendering `ejs` files.
## This is also responsible for taking with the DataBase server i.e. Fetching data , saving Data
### It creates a `socket` connection with the clients and will recieve msg from one client in a room and send it to everyone else in the same room, The `Peer-connection script` in the `ğŸ“‚public/ğŸ“‚scripts` makes a peer-to-peer connection with every client in a room with webrtc and sends flow of data i.e. Video,audio that we use for the videocall.
### Executing the following code we recieve the peer instancce from the peer server and will create a `webrtc client` that we have created in the folder `ğŸ“‚peerserver`

```javascript
const myPeer = new Peer(undefined, {
  key:'peerjs',
  host: 'debo-peerjs.herokuapp.com',
  port: '',
  secure:true,
    // this config contains the ice-server configs(turn,stun servers)
   config: {'iceServers':[
    { url: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' }, //this is the stun server 
    {
      url: 'turn_url',
      credential: 'turn_password',
      username: 'turn_username'
  }
  ]}});
```

<mark><b>In this Code and Explanation `iceserver,stun,turn` are some keywords used. I have explained this things why we use them and what they are in this [video](https://1drv.ms/v/s!Aqiu0gLTQJGHji8VLAzz5nWOgCJF)(This onedrive page need a reload sometimes).</b> </mark>

# Getting Started with Create React App 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
